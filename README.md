# Traffic Light System in React

This project implements a traffic light system with pedestrian crossing functionality and an optional emergency vehicle override feature using React. The system cycles through green, yellow, and red lights, and allows pedestrians to request a crossing, which interrupts the normal light cycle after the current sequence completes.

## Features

- **Automatic Light Transitions**: Lights automatically transition from Green to Yellow to Red and back to Green.
- **Pedestrian Button**: Pedestrians can request a red light for safe crossing.
- **Emergency Override (Optional)**: An override button can interrupt the light cycle to allow emergency vehicles to pass.
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays a countdown timer for each light transition.
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions are used to smoothly change light colors.
